# Social Media Engagement Analysis using LangFlow and Datastax Astra DB

This project utilizes **LangFlow** and **Datastax Astra DB** to analyze social media engagement data. The setup processes raw input data, extracts insights, and presents results in a structured and natural language format. Below is an overview of each component in the workflow.

## Components of the Workflow

### 1. Chat Input
- Captures input from users or chat interfaces.
- Accepts queries or raw information for analysis.

### 2. Parse Data
- Converts raw input data into plain-text format based on a specified template.
- Standardizes data for further processing.

### 3. Prompt
- Highly customizable to meet specific analysis requirements.
- Ensures clarity and consistency in the output format.

### 4. Split Text
- Divides large text data into smaller chunks using parameters like chunk size, overlap, and separators.
- Handles extensive text datasets efficiently.
- Maintains context with overlapping chunks.
- Supports adjustable parameters for tailored analysis.

### 5. Embedding Data and Storage in VectorDB
- Utilizes NVIDIAâ€™s model to transform data into dense vector embeddings for efficient storage and similarity-based searches.
- Stores embeddings in a **VectorDB** implemented within Astra DB, leveraging efficient indexing techniques.
- Supports fast and precise similarity-based searches and real-time data retrieval.

### 6. Chat Output
- Displays results in an interactive chat-like format.
- Provides enhanced readability with custom formatting options for better visual clarity.

## Usage

- **Input Requirements**: The workflow accepts raw social media data in text or file formats.
- **Output**: Generates insights and comparative analysis of social media engagement.
- **Customization**: Modify templates, chunk sizes, or database configurations to fit specific requirements.

## Key Features
- Efficient handling of extensive text datasets with chunking and embedding.
- Real-time data retrieval and similarity-based searches using VectorDB.
- Interactive and user-friendly output presentation.
